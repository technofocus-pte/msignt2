# Integrating Azure OpenAI service and AI service for Customer Engagement

>**Introduction:** In this task, we will integrate the Azure OpenAI chatbot into Contoso Bank’s customer engagement platforms. The chatbot will serve as an interactive tool for customers, helping them explore loan products, get personalized loan recommendations, and receive real-time assistance. We will use Azure OpenAI’s natural language processing capabilities to ensure the chatbot delivers a smooth, human-like experience while collecting valuable customer data for further analysis.

### **Task 1 : Set Up Azure AI Search service**

In this task, we create Azure AI Search service for enriching the chatbot with search and query capabilities based on customer data and loan details.

1.  Switch back to Azure portal and search for `Azure AI search` and select it.

### **Task 2 : Create Azure AI multi-service resource**

In this task, we will create an AI multi-service resource for NLP to enrich data and interact with customers through the chat app.

1.  Follow the steps below to create an Azure AI multi-service resource in the **same region (location) as that of your Azure search service**.

2.  Open a new tab in a browser and go to  `https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesAllInOne`
    Sign in with your Azure subscription account

3.  Enter below values and then click on **Review + create**.

    - Subscription : Your Azure subscription

    - Resource group : Your existing resource group

    - Region : **Same region as your Search service region**

    - Name : `cbsb-aimultiserviceXXXX` (XXXX can be unique number)

    - Price tier : **Standard S0**

    - Select **By checking this box I acknowledge that I have read and understood all the terms below** check box.

    - Name -  `cbazopenaiXXXX` (XXXX can be unique number)

    - Price tier -**Standard S0**

    ![](./media/image99.png)

4.  Click on **Next- > Next- > Create** slelecting the default settings.

    ![](./media/image100.png)

    ![](./media/image101.png)

    ![](./media/image102.png)

5.  Once the deployment completes, click on **Go to resource**.

    ![](./media/image103.png)

6.  Expand Resource management from left navigation ,click on **Keys and  Endpoint**. Copy URL in the **Endpoint** field and save in your notepad as **AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT**.
    Copy the **Key 1** value and save as **AZURE_OPENAI_KEY**. 

    ![](./media/image104.png)

7.  Click on **Overview** tab on the left navigation panel, and then click on **Go to Azure OpenAI Studio**. Azure OpenAI Studio opens in new tab.

    ![](./media/image107.png)

10. Search for `gpt-35-turbo-16k` and select it. Click on **Confirm**. GPT-3.5 models can understand and generate natural language or code. GPT-3.5 Turbo is the most capable and cost effective model in the GPT-3.5 family, which has been optimized for chat and works well for traditional completions tasks as well.

    ![](./media/image108.png)

11. In the deployment dialogbox, click on **Customize** button
